## Description 
Welcome to our library project written in Python with Django and SQLite3 database! With our project, you can easily log in and keep track of the books you have borrowed from the library.

Our user-friendly interface allows you to easily search for books, add them to your personal library, and keep track of due dates. The SQLite3 database ensures that your data is stored securely and efficiently.

With our project, you can say goodbye to the hassle of keeping track of borrowed books on paper. Simply log in and add your books to your library, and our system will take care of the rest.
